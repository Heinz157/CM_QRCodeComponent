## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about how the CSS flexbox works with multiple components within a div. Also my first time working with figma files so that was a good experience to have with a simple project like this.


### Continued development

I wanted this project to be the start for me to begin diving deeper into what Frontend Mentor has to offer. I plan on continuing to work on the challenges and learning more about the different technologies that are used in the projects.
